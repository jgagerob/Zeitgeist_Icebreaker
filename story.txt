Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Petey that was absolutely obsessed with bratwursts.
Most days, Petey would sit with his friend Carl the Hund and eat bratwursts and gebaeck, waiting for something interesting to happen.
On a hot sunny afternoon while walking on hauptstrasse, he saw a really expensive porche drive by and an idea popped into his head. 
"Carl...why don't we put on our finest dirndels, buy a nice Porsche, and go to a Rammstein concert?"
Carl, who just wanted to get to the baeckerei since it had klimaanlage, agreed to his friends random idea.
On the way to the Porsche dealership, Petey realized that he and Carl already blew all their cash on bratwursts and gebaeck, so they would have to start a baeckerei or a klimaanlage repair service to earn the money necessary to pursue their endeavor.
Heading to the bank Petey saw a Ferraria Red BMW heading towards Berlin and contemplated the choice between the two cars. 
Before entering the bank they notice a Wettbewerbsfaehig doener contest, there they recognize Mehlhase participating. 
Mehlhase was about to finish all of her doener's and win the contest when a pack of hunds tore through the biergarten where the festival was being held.
She was wearing a dirndel and looked ready to go to Eltz! 
It was an extremely hot day, so I headed to the nearest Ratskeller for some Klimaanlage.
By now it was late so I took my Porsche back to my schloss where I couldn't fit through the door because I realized I was still a giraffe. 
Giraffes are very fond of Apfelkuchen so I went to the beergarden to get a piece.
