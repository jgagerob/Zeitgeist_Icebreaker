Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Petey that was absolutely obsessed with bratwursts.
Most days, Petey would sit with his friend Carl the Hund and eat bratwursts and gebaeck, waiting for something interesting to happen.
On a sunny afternoon while walking on hauptstrasse, he saw a really expensive porche drive by and an idea popped into his head.
